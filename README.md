# TowerOfHanoi_Solution
Visual Simulation of Tower of Hanoi Solution in C++ using OpenGL Libraries



## Description
Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks.
The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

  1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
  2) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack (3rd stack) i.e. a disk can only be          moved if it is the  uppermost disk on a stack.
  3) No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
